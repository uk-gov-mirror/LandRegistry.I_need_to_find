        <p> Different documents will give you different information. You can buy the documents in any combination. For example, you can choose to buy the title plan and deeds or just the title register.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Copy of title register</h2>
          <p> The title register has details about the property or land. It includes:
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>the title number</li>
                <li> who owns it </li>
                <li>what they paid for it (properties only, if available)</li>
                <li>any rights of way</li>
                <li>whether the property is freehold or leasehold (known as ‘tenure’) </li>
                <li>the lender’s name and address (if there is a mortgage on the property) </li>
                <li>whether a mortgage on it has been ‘discharged’, for example paid off </li>
          </div>

            <div>
              <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Copy of title plan</h2>
              <p> The title plan is a map showing the: </p>
              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>property’s location</li>
                  <li>general boundaries </li>
              </ul>
              <p> There's usually no record of:
              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>the exact boundary between two properties</li>
                  <li>who owns the hedge, wall, tree or fence between 2 properties </li>
              </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
             <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"> Copy of the deeds </h2>
             <p> Copies of the deeds can give you:</p>
             <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                 <li>current and past information about a registered property, such as its previous owners</li>
                 <li>more details about rights over adjoining land  </li>
             </ul>

             <div class="govuk-inset-text">
               Copies of deeds can’t be used to prove ownership, for example in a court case. Get an official copy of the title register instead.
