      <p>Use this service to get information about a property in England and Wales, even if you don't own it.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Free information</h2>
      <p> HM Land Registry holds records about most property or land sold in England or Wales since 1993. We can give you some of this information for free.
      This includes general boundaries (title extent) for freehold properties, price paid history and planning application details. </p>
      <p> We can also tell you if the are any more entries in the register that may affect the use of the property - for details you'll need to pay a fee.</p>
